Between March 25th and 27th, 2025, we had the pleasure of attending the European Robotics Forum (ERF) 2025 in Stuttgart, Germany. The event was organised by the European Robotics Association (euRobotics).

The event was a unique opportunity to explore the latest advancements in robotics and automation, with a special focus on the European robotics community. The forum featured a series of presentations, workshops, and discussions showcasing the latest research and innovations in the field. The event's reach was truly international, with participants from all over the world, including researchers, industry professionals, and students. The event provided a platform for networking and collaboration, fostering partnerships and research collaborations that will drive advancements in robotics and automation.
