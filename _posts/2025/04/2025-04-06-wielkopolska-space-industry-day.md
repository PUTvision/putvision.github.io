Last Friday, April 4th, 2025, we had the pleasure of attending the Wielkopolska Space Industry Day in Poznań. The event was organised by the Polish Space Agency (POLSA) in the Marshal's Office of the Wielkopolska Region. It was a unique opportunity to explore the potential of Polish companies, research centres, and institutions operating in the space sector, with a special focus on innovation in Wielkopolska.

A key highlight of the event was the inauguration of ESA Phi-Lab Poland and ESA Spaceship Poland, new space initiatives led by Poznań University of Technology, our university. The event featured a series of presentations and discussions showcasing the latest advancements in space technology and innovation.
