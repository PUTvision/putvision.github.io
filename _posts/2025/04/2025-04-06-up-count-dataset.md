> The introduced UP-COUNT dataset includes drone footage captured with cameras from the DJI Mini 2 family UAV. It encompasses diverse environments, including streets, plazas, public transport stops, parks and other green recreation places. We recorded 202 unique videos and then extracted frames with a step of one second, resulting in 10,000 images with a resolution of 3840 × 2160 pixels. The recordings were taken at different altitudes and speeds of flight, and with various densities of people. Acquisition conditions vary in daytime and lighting, creating challenging shadows. Extra altitude information is provided for each image. Next, the labels of people’s heads were hand-prepared, resulting in 352,487 instances.
