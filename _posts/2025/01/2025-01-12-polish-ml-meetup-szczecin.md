Last Saturday, we had the pleasure of attending the PolishML Community Meetup in Szczecin, held at the ZUT Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology.

During the event, Bartosz delivered a presentation on recent trends in space robotics, with a particular focus on Edge AI devices and their applications in space exploration. The presentation sparked an engaging discussion on the future of space robotics and the evolving role of AI in upcoming missions.

**Presentation abstract**

> Recent advances in space robotics, particularly in the context of lunar missions, have been significantly accelerated by the adaptation of consumer technology. A key driver of this trend is the integration of deep learning accelerators into satellites, rovers, and landers, enabling faster, more cost-effective, and autonomous decision-making. This presentation explores the concept of Edge AI devices, their current role in the NewSpace sector, and how vision systems and machine learning can enhance lunar robotics, illustrated through a project at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.

We extend our gratitude to the organizers for the invitation and to all participants for the thought-provoking discussions. We look forward to the next edition of the PolishML Community Meetup!
