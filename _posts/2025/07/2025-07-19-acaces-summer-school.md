In the mid of July 2025, 13-19, in Fiuggi, Italy, was the 21st International Summer School on Advanced Computer Architecture and Compilation for High-performance Embedded Systems (ACACES) organized by the High Performance, Edge And Cloud computing (HiPEAC) Network. Our PUT Vision Lab was represented by Mateusz, who was one of the 200 attendees from 100 institutions across 23 countries. Based on the proposal and registration form, he was again selected and awarded a grant covering the participation costs.

Within the week, Mateusz attended the following sessions:
- Trust, Threat, and AI: Security Challenges in Generative & Collaborative Learning
- Dataflow-based modeling and design
- Toward Sustainable Computing
- Prompt Engineering: Leveraging Large Language Models
