Between June 25th and 26th, 2025, we had the pleasure of attending the **I Doctoral Workshop on Space Robotics** in Málaga, Spain. The event was organised by the University of Málaga and the European Space Agency Academy. The workshop was a unique opportunity for PhD students and early-career researchers to present their work, exchange ideas, and network with peers in the field of space robotics. Heads of european space robotics laboratories were also present, providing valuable insights and feedback on the participants' research.

We had the oportunity to represent our laboratory and present our research:

  - Dominik presented "Computer Vision Laboratory" - a talk about our research in the field of computer vision, including the latest advancements and applications in space robotics.

  - Bartosz's presentation was titled "Space Robotics Meets Traversability Map Estimation With Bird's Eye View Representation", highlighting the potential of this approach.
