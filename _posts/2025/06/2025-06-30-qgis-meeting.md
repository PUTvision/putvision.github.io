On June 25th and 26th, 2025, Marek and Przemyslaw actively participated in the IV QGIS Users Meeting (IV spotkanie użytkowników QGIS) held at the Faculty of Chemistry of Lodz University of Technology.

On Wednesday, Marek presented our recent advancements in the Deepness plugin and its applications to a broad audience of approximately 450 QGIS experts. His presentation was followed by a networking session that generated many new and promising ideas for future model and plugin development. On Thursday, Przemysław and Marek served as experts on a discussion panel titled "AI in GIS: Will Artificial Intelligence Change the Industry?"

We are delighted to report that our Deepness plugin has gained significant traction since its presentation at last year's conference! It has successfully encouraged GIS experts to integrate machine learning techniques with their expertise, exemplified by a presentation on the identification of asbestos roofs on aerial photographs using Deepness. Furthermore, one of the workshops at the conference specifically covered the usage of the Deepness plugin.

# Deepness

Deepness - an open-source plugin for the QGIS application, allowing the easy employment of neural network models on any raster layer representing a matrix of values or image data. Deep neural networks show a clear improvement in computer vision tasks, enabling the automatic performance of, among others, regression, segmentation and detection of objects in the images. The Deepness plugin supports model types that complete the abovementioned tasks, linking deep learning inference directly with the most popular geographic information system (GIS) application. Moreover, a model registry with ready-to-use models is provided, bringing the power of deep learning to users without machine learning expertise. This enables augmenting the familiar, established workflow with new functionalities.
