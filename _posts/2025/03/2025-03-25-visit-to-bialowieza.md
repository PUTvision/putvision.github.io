Members of our team have visited Prof. Eng. Rafał Kowalczyk from Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Białowieża, Poland. The goal of the visit was to research the level of rapeseed crop damages caused by european bisons.

## European bisons and the rapeseed fields

As the population of european bisons in the Białowieża area grows, the amount of available food in the forest, especially during winter, proves insufficient. This causes the wisents to search elsewhere. They often venture into nearby agricultural fields, with rapeseed crops being one of their preferred food sources. This leads to some damage to the crops, causing potential financial losses for local farmers.

To better understand the scale of the problem, our team conducted multispectral imaging using UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). The collected data allowed us to create detailed orthophotos of the affected fields, highlighting the areas damaged by the bisons.

## Multispectral imaging and analysis

Using multispectral cameras mounted on UAVs, we captured images in various spectral bands. This technology enables us to differentiate between healthy and damaged vegetation. By analyzing the data, we can estimate the extent of the damage and provide valuable insights to both researchers and farmers.

As we collected data both from damaged and intact fields, we will be able to map them again in a couple of months and see how the bisons impacted the development of the rapeseed. To the best of our knowledge, this was never thoroughly investigated.

## Collaboration with local researchers

Our collaboration with Prof. Eng. Rafał Kowalczyk is instrumental in understanding the behavior of european bisons and their interaction with agricultural landscapes. By combining ecological expertise with advanced imaging technologies, we hope to contribute to sustainable solutions that balance wildlife conservation with agricultural needs.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress and findings from this exciting project!
