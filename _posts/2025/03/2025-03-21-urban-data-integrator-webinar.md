Yesterday (20.03.2025), Bartosz Ptak presented the Deepness plugin during the Urban Data Integrator Webinar organized by the [Institute of Urban and Regional Development](https://danemiejskie.pl/).

## Urban Data Integrator

The Urban Data Integrator IRMiR (UDI for short) is the first research and advisory program in Poland dedicated to urban data and its use in local governments.

The idea for UDI originated at the Institute of Urban and Regional Development, which, while creating expert opinions and studies, struggled with the problem of low-quality data obtained from local governments. Research conducted over several years has convinced us that this is a widespread problem, occurring on various scales in every city in Poland. Incorrectly managed data resources and the lack of their integration make it difficult to properly manage a city using knowledge supported by analysis results.

## Webinar - Deepness plugin

During the webinar, Bartosz Ptak presented the Deepness plugin, which is a tool for spatial data analysis in QGIS. The plugin enables easy integration of deep learning models with spatial data analysis. The plugin is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, even for people who are not familiar with deep learning.
