On February 11, we met with foresters in pine forests attacked by mistletoe to investigate the possibility of monitoring its spread using drones.

The occurrence of mistletoe on conifers is becoming increasingly problematic, threatening forest management. By monitoring it, preventive work can be better planned.

We collected data from three forests, mapping over a dozen hectares of forests using a multispectral camera (RGB + 4 multispectral bands) with a DJI M3M drone

The next step will be to analyze the data and assess the usefulness of multispectral data for detecting mistletoe.
