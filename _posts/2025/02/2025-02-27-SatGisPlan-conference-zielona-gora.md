The SatGisPlan 2025 conference, recently held at the Space Technology Park in Nowy Kisielin, proved to be a very interesting and lively event. It uniquely blended academia, industry, and professional networking. Among the panel participants was our very own Marek Kraft, one of the participants in the panel “Accelerating the future: AI, robotics, innovation and financing”.

The event emphasised showcasing the work of graduates from the Geoinformatics and Satellite Techniques (GITS) program at the University of Zielona Góra - it was terrific to see the University’s commitment to empowering the next generation of professionals in the field.

In addition to a rich scientific program, the event featured an exhibition with participants from industry, academia, and public sector organisations. This created numerous opportunities to forge valuable professional connections, facilitating meaningful interactions and potential future collaborations.

Overall, participation in SatGisPlan 2025 was a valuable experience - we’re looking forward to sending out representation next year!
