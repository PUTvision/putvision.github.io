In the mid of July 2024, 14-20, in Fiuggi, Italy, was the 20th International Summer School on Advanced Computer Architecture and Compilation for High-performance Embedded Systems (ACACES) organized by the High Performance, Edge And Cloud computing (HiPEAC) Network. Our PUT Vision Lab was represented by Mateusz, who was one of the 200 attendees from 100 institutions across 25 countries. Based on the proposal and registration form, he was selected and awarded a grant covering the participation costs. 

Within the week, Mateusz attended the following sessions:
- Memory Systems and Memory-Centric Computing
- Building Robust and Adaptive Edge AI Systems
- Edge Cyber-Infrastructure: Architecting, Building, and Using HPC-connected Edge-AI Systems for Scientific Applications
- Optimizing and Compiling Neural Networks for RISC-V Multi-Core Processors

Moreover, the summer school had a dedicated time slot for a poster session, at which Mateusz presented his work realized during the internship at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. In the extended abstract and poster entitled **_Empowering On-Device Training: Leveraging Inference Accelerators for Enhanced Training Efficiency_** he demonstrated the possibility of operating a high-performance inference accelerator for enhancing on-device training.
