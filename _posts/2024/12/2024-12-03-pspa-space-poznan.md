Last friday, we had a pleasure to participate in the [Polish Space Professionals Association](https://pspa.pl/) meetup. The event was held at the [Poznań University of Technology](https://put.poznan.pl/), where we had a chance to meet with other space enthusiasts and professionals from the region.

During the meetup, Bartosz presented his recent work on "Enhancing Lunar Robotics Rover through Deep Learning and Edge AI". The presentation covered the challenges of operating a rover in a lunar environment and possibilities of using deep learning and edge AI to improve its performance. Bartosz shared his experience in developing and testing the rover's vision system, which leverages computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect rocks on the lunar surface. The presentation sparked a lively discussion about the future of robotics and computer vision in space exploration and the role of AI in enhancing mission capabilities.
