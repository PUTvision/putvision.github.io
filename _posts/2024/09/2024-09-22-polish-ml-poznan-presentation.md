## How to fly a drone to a destination without GPS (most of the time) using machine learning?

Marek Kraft had the pleasure of presenting at the [Polish ML Community event in Poznań](https://polishml.community/21-09-2024-w-poznaniu/), where he discussed methods for drone localisation without relying on GNSS. His presentation focused on utilising a camera and an environmental map to determine the drone's position. The approach involved leveraging a particle filter to estimate location, with the evaluation based on a variety of metrics, including simple correlation, a combination of texture and colour features, and neural network-based metric learning to generate embeddings. 

The audience received the presentation warmly, and the ensuing discussion sparked a lively exchange of ideas on advanced localisation techniques.
