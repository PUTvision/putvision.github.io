Between March and June 2024, Mateusz interned in the High Performance Real Time Laboratory (HiPeRT Lab) at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE). He realized research tasks related to model optimization and hardware acceleration in the context of computer vision models' inference and on-device training. Mateusz studied the possibility of on-device training acceleration with high-performance inference accelerators for continual learning applications on resource-constrained hardware.
