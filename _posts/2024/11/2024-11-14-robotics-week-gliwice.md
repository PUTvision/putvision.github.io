> New technologies, miniaturisation, increasing computing capacities and advanced IT systems, have made robots an integral part of technological progress.

At [Robotics Week](https://www.polsl.pl/ps_aktualnosci/tydzien-robotow-na-politechnice-slaskiej/#:~:text=Dla%20szk%C3%B3%C5%82%20podstawowych%20i%20ponadpodstawowych,do%2017%20listopada%202024%20roku.), held at the Silesian University of Technology, our team showcased our laboratory's latest projects in ground, aerial, and space robotics. The event attracted students, researchers, and industry representatives, who had the opportunity to discuss the latest trends in robotics. Our presentation was enhanced by the presence of ExoMy rovers - fully functional, 3D-printed replicas of the [ExoMy rover](https://esa-prl.github.io/ExoMy/) developed by the European Space Agency (ESA).
