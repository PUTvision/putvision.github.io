Upon invitation from Prof. Dr. Magda Gregorova, the head of the THWS (Technische Hochschule Würzburg-Schweinfurt) Center for Artificial Intelligence (CAIRO), Marek Kraft visited THWS from April 15th to April 19th, 2024 as a part of his Erasmus+ stay. The aim of the visit was to enhance international cooperation and foster collaborative research endeavors.

## Research Collaboration

During his visit, Dr. Kraft engaged in highly productive meetings with researchers from both CAIRO and the Center for Robotics and Embedded Intelligence (CERI). These interactions were characterized by deep technical discussions on the integration of computer vision and machine learning algorithms into various application areas. The discussions explored advanced methodologies for deploying vision sensors and hardware platforms in real-world scenarios. The strategic partnership between PUT and THWS, established during previous visits, provided a robust framework for these collaborative efforts.

## Technical Discussions

In Würzburg, Dr. Kraft engaged in in-depth technical conversations with CAIRO staff members. The discussions focused on leveraging machine vision systems for artificial intelligence applications, including object recognition, scene understanding, and autonomous systems. Insights were exchanged on the latest advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning techniques, and their practical implementations in diverse domains. These exchanges broadened the scope of potential joint projects and paved the way for innovative research avenues.

## Collaborative Opportunities

As part of the collaboration strategy, Prof. Gregorova and Dr. Kraft visited the Center for Robotics in Schweinfurt to further explore the interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities, particularly in the integration of AI-driven computer vision with advanced robotic systems. Potential projects involving robotic perception, sensor fusion, and intelligent control systems were discussed, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications.
Looking ahead, plans have been outlined for follow-up visits and joint research projects between PUT, CAIRO, and CERI. The collaborative efforts will focus on synergizing PUT’s expertise in computer vision with CAIRO’s cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and CERI’s emphasis on robotics and embedded systems. The partnership holds great potential for groundbreaking research and technological advancements in the fields of AI, computer vision, and robotics.
