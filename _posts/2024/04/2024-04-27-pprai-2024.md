Last week, we had the pleasure of attending the PP RAI 2024 conference hosted at the Warsaw University of Technology. The event was filled with captivating talks, insightful keynotes, and engaging posters, all topped off by an exceptional gala dinner. It provided an excellent platform for exchanging experiences with fellow researchers and engineers.

## The best paper finalist

For the second year in a row, we returned with an accolade! Our paper titled “Elevating point-based object detection in UAVs: A deep learning method with altitude fusion” authored by Michał Wiliński, Bartosz Ptak, and Marek Kraft has been honored with the Best Paper Award Finalist prize.
