Last week we had a great opportunity to visit two Danish universities: [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en) and [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). The meetings were very fruitful and we had a chance to discuss our research and possible future collaboration in the field of remote sensing for nature environment monitoring, smart surveillance, and precise agriculture.


## SDU UAS Center, University of Southern Denmark

The first meeting was held at the [SDU UAS Center](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduuascenter) and refers to the mobility project which will be realized by Bartosz this spring. Next, we participated in the lunch seminar where we introduced the audience to our Deepness plugin for QGIS software. We also had a chance to see the drone lab talk to the researchers from the center and exchange our experience and possible future collaboration.


## Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, University of Copenhagen

The second meeting was held at the [Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management](https://ign.ku.dk/english/) at the University of Copenhagen. We had a chance to share our experience in the field of computer vision and deep learning, discussing research needs for the future and possible collaboration. 

## Summary

We would like to thank our hosts for the invitation and great time. We are looking forward to future collaboration and sharing knowledge and experience!
