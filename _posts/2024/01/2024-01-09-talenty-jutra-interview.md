<BR>

In mid-December, as the [Talenty Jutra](https://www.talentyjutra.pl/) grant recipient, I was invited to the headquarters of the [Fundacja Empiria i Wiedza](https://empiriaiwiedza.pl/) to give a short interview about my research project (about which more information can be found in the [The winning research project in the Talenty Jutra grant program](https://putvision.github.io/publication/talenty-jutra-competition/)).

## Interview

A few days ago, an interview with my participation was published on the foundation's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FundacjaEmpiriaiWiedza). The interview in Polish is available by clicking on the image below or using [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23X1KHNw8_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23X1KHNw8_A) hyperlink. 

I strongly encourage you to check out this interview and my project!
