## Vision in robotics - how machine learning algorithms enable robot perception

Bartosz Ptak had a pleasure to present at the [Polish ML Community - Olsztyn](https://polishml.community/cfp-olsztyn-01-07-2023-zbieramy-zgloszenia/) meetup and talked about Vision in Robotics.

Abstract:
> What is robotics and why should it interest you? If you're not already familiar with it, a brief history of yesterday and the potential of tomorrow will show just how many possibilities this field offers. There will also be an outline of the latest developments and trends in robotics, including the application of vision systems and machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. Vision systems are a key component of robots, enabling them to “see” the world and make appropriate decisions. Among other things, the presentation will answer the question of how vision-based robotic systems are already influencing intelligent agriculture and space exploration.
