<BR>

Successful application of deep learning to remote sensing and GIS data still requires a certain amount of domain expertise in machine learning and data engineering. To overcome this barrier, we introduced Deepness: Deep Neural Remote Sensing [QGIS](https://qgis.org/pl/site/) plugin. Now we are happy to present it published in _SoftwareX_ journal!

## Abstract:

Deepness - an open-source plugin for the QGIS application, allowing the easy employment of neural network models on any raster layer representing a matrix of values or image data. Deep neural networks show a clear improvement in computer vision tasks, enabling the automatic performance of, among others, regression, segmentation and detection of objects in the images. The Deepness plugin supports model types that complete the abovementioned tasks, linking deep learning inference directly with the most popular geographic information system (GIS) application. Moreover, a model registry with ready-to-use models is provided, bringing the power of deep learning to users without machine learning expertise. This enables augmenting the familiar, established workflow with new functionalities.
