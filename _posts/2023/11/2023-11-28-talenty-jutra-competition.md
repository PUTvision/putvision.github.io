On November 27-28, 2023, the third [3W Congress](https://kongres3w.pl/iii-kongres-3w/) was held in Warsaw. One of the congress highlights was the final round of the [Talenty Jutra](https://www.talentyjutra.pl/) competition, which is a research grant program established and supported by [Fundacja Empiria i Wiedza](https://empiriaiwiedza.pl/). In the second edition of this contest, our research group was represented by Mateusz Piechocki, whose research proposal was recognized by the jury and awarded a grant of 25,000 PLN.


## Research project

***Title:*** Smart solution for accurate irradiance forecasting in a short time horizon

***Abstract:*** Predicting irradiance in the efficient utilization of energy generated by photovoltaic panels is a significant challenge with crucial implications in the field of renewable energy and energy resource management. Existing solutions rely on meteorological data or simple predictive models using historical data that do not account for local short-term changes associated with dynamic atmospheric conditions, such as cloud movement. Due to these limitations, accurate forecasting of irradiance values directly impacting solar energy production requires the application of more sophisticated methods that consider both temporal and spatial changes.

The project envisions the development and expansion of a perceptual module and predictive algorithm, enabling more precise solar irradiance forecasting in the short term than currently available solutions. Furthermore, the integration of the proposed solutions with edge systems will allow intelligent and automated control of photovoltaic systems and farms in real time, emphasizing the potential impact of the proposed solution on energy management.

Fundamentality, research, and preliminary evaluation of the presented project have been verified through a review of scientific literature, preliminary studies, and tests on irradiance prediction methods using image regression techniques and publicly available datasets. The current stage of work involves preparing a representative dataset for conditions prevailing in Poland. In the subsequent steps, the impact of the proposed solution on forecasted irradiance values and the quality of energy management will be investigated, ultimately leading to a detailed comparison of the obtained results with currently available commercial solutions.

## Fundacja Empiria i Wiedza

[Fundacja Empiria i Wiedza](https://empiriaiwiedza.pl/) was established by [Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego](https://www.bgk.pl/) to build and develop the potential of Polish social capital, aiming to create a better future for Poland through investments in education based on equal opportunities for access. This initiative aligns with the cultural principles and mission of BGK, which emphasizes the development of sustainable socio-economic growth in Poland, driven by a concern for the country, the world, and the fate of future generations.

The foundation's goals are realized through the education of Poles at various levels, starting from school-age youth, through university students, and extending to individuals holding key positions in strategic sectors of state-owned companies. In addition, it involves education that supports the development of the most talented while simultaneously equalizing opportunities and ensuring equal access to knowledge for all citizens.

### Talenty Jutra

[Talenty Jutra](https://www.talentyjutra.pl/) is an initiative directed towards young individuals aged 19-25 who are taking their first steps in the world of science, engineering, and medicine. The grant program aims to inspire young people to create innovations and undertake scientific research projects.

Participants in the program compete for grants totaling 25,000 PLN to continue, expand the scope of scientific research, or develop and improve inventions. It also serves as an excellent opportunity for learning the process of applying for and securing a grant.

The competition committee, comprised of scientists, representatives from higher education authorities, and business professionals, evaluates factors such as the originality and innovation of presented projects, their significance for the development of a given scientific discipline, and the feasibility of the planned activities.
