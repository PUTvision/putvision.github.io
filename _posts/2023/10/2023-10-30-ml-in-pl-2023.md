Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of participating in [ML in PL 2023 conference](https://conference2023.mlinpl.org/) at the Copernicus Science Centre, Warsaw. Its agenda covered keynote lectures, panel discussions, networking, and poster sessions. The event is mainly focused on machine Learning, both in academia and in business.

Bartosz Ptak had a pleasure to present our work on **"ENHANCING LUNAR ROBOTICS ROVER THROUGH DEEP LEARNING AND EDGE AI"** (co-authored with Marek Kraft and Dominik Pieczy≈Ñski). He shared several highlights about Edge AI devices and the deployment of deep learning models on them using our robotic space project as an example.
